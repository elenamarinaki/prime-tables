# Prime Tables 🧩

This application takes numeric input (N) from a user and outputs a multiplication table of (N) prime numbers.
Programming used for the project: `JavaScript`

### How to run the application 🎲

The user gives a number in the input field and presses `Enter`. The application outputs a **(N+1) x (N+1) grid of numbers**.

## STAGES 🧱

I tried to separate each task to a different function. This way testing is easier and more effective. 🔬

The application was built in the following stages:

- CONSOLE stage 🖥

  - I first created a prime numbers generator function `primeNumbersGenerator()`. This is an iterable entity that outputs prime numbers. It checks if an integer is divisible by 1 or itself, and registers it as **prime** with `yield`.
  - The next function `giveNPrimeNumbers()` iterates the generator with upper limit an input `N`, that is the argument of the function itself. It returns an array `primesArr` with the first `N` primes, plus an extra empty slot at the beginning.
  - I devised the `makePrimeTable()` function, to output the table on the console. The formatting is achieved through a _string variable_ `rowOutput` that serves as each row of the array. The first row is populated with the original output of primes from the `giveNPrimeNumbers()`, separated by the `|` character. Each subsequent row is populated with the multipliers of each one of the same prime numbers with every other one in the array.
  - The result for an input N = 3 is:<br />
    | 2 | 3 | 5 |<br />
    2 | 4 | 6 | 10 |<br />
    3 | 6 | 9 | 15 |<br />
    5 | 10 | 15 | 25 |<br />

- APPLICATION stage 🟪 🟧 🟨

  - The main decision I have to make for this stage is if I would just create an element and output the console result as a text, **or** something more visually pleasing, such as presenting the results in an actual table, using the `<table>`.
  - My first approach was to create the `makePrimeTableHTML()` function (commented out in the *script.js*). This was a slightly modified version of `makePrimeTable()`, that was just presenting the console formatted result in an HTML page. The presentation was not very efficient this way, as a layout problem was created through the use of `white-space: pre;` in the CSS. The `white-space: pre;` was necessary to parse the `new line` character through the `.textContent` method in js.
